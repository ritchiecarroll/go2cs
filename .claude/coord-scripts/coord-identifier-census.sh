# coord-identifier-census.sh -- the fleet's ONE identifier census. Reference consumer of
# coord-identifier-patterns.txt (the ONE definition of the arms) and coord-identifier-hashes.txt
# (the ONE list of denied names, as hashes, generated from the repository's own Go guard).
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW A POST TOOL ADOPTS IT
#
#   C="$(dirname "$0")/coord-identifier-census.sh"
#   "$C" entry   "$ENTRYFILE"        || exit $?      # THE GATE
#   "$C" subject "$COMMIT_SUBJECT"   || exit $?      # THE GATE
#   git fetch origin claude/mailbox                  # then, and only then:
#   TIP="$(git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD)"
#   "$C" tree docs/phase4/MAILBOX.md "$TIP"          # A READING. Do not gate the push on it.
#   # ... append, commit, push.
#
# Each gate call exits non-zero on a refusal, so `|| exit $?` is the whole wiring. THE CENSUS RUNS IN
# ITS OWN COMMAND, BEFORE the push and NOT in the same chain as it: a census composed into the push
# chain lets the push run on whatever the census printed. A census whose exit code does not gate the
# push is a guard built and not armed.
#
# ⚠ TREE MODE IS A READING, NOT THE GATE, AND ITS BASELINE IS THE FETCHED TIP.
#
# `entry` and `subject` are what decides whether a post may go out: they read the bytes this lane
# wrote, in STRICT mode, and nothing else. `tree` answers a different question -- what does the
# shared surface hold, and what would this append add to it -- and its answer is only as good as its
# baseline.
#
# THE BASELINE MUST BE THE TIP BLOB AS FETCHED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE APPEND. Never a lane's
# last-read sha, never a stored anchor, never "the sha I posted last time". Everything other lanes
# landed in between is otherwise attributed to THIS post. C2 measured both arms on one clean entry:
# baseline = its own last-read sha gave added=4 and REFUSED; baseline = the freshly fetched tip gave
# added=0 and CLEAN. The four were six other lanes' entries that had landed in the interval. Same
# post, same bytes, opposite verdicts -- the difference was entirely the baseline.
#
# So a post tool calls tree AFTER its fetch, with the sha that fetch produced, and treats a non-zero
# exit as something to READ rather than something to obey. A pre-existing hit on a shared surface is
# not this post's to fix and not this post's to be blocked by.
#
# NO POST TOOL EVER PASSES --unmask. See MASKING below.
#
# THE RULE: NO TOOL CARRIES A PRIVATE COPY OF ANY ARM. If an arm is wrong, it is wrong HERE, for
# everyone, and it is fixed HERE. A tool that adds a local pattern has re-created the three-tools-
# three-definitions state this file exists to end. A tool that needs an arm WIDENED for one case
# passes that widening as a per-arm admit set in the patterns file -- never as a list every arm
# shares, which widens all of them.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RELATION TO THE REPOSITORY'S OWN GO GUARD
#
# src/go2cs/internal/repoguard/fleetIdentifierCensus_test.go (TestNoFleetIdentifiersInTrackedFiles)
# is the TRACKED-TREE gate: it runs under the plain `go test ./...`, scans every tracked file, and
# is the authority on the structural classes and on which names are denied. This census is the
# PRE-POST gate: it runs before anything becomes tracked or pushed, over an entry body, a commit
# subject, or a shared transport file.
#
#   same classes  the profile/home arm is that file's fleetProfileRe, split into its two
#                 alternatives; the backslash share arm is its fleetNetworkRe; the placeholder admit
#                 set is its fleetIsPlaceholder plus fleetPlaceholderSegments, consulted by the
#                 profile, home AND unc arms exactly as fleetConsiderSegment consults it for every
#                 kind; the UNC host admit set is its fleetNicknameHostSegments, exactly those four
#                 and no more.
#   same names    coord-identifier-hashes.txt is generated from its fleetDeniedTokens. Neither file
#                 carries plaintext.
#   same tokens   candidates are maximal [a-z0-9._-] runs PLUS each dot/hyphen/underscore component,
#                 which is what makes a machine name and the account name inside it both match.
#   what is new   the IPv4 arm, the forward-slash share arm, the host-assignment arm and the
#                 owner-name-in-prose arm have no counterpart there and are marked as additions.
#   what differs  the Go guard hashes every token of every tracked file in process. A shell census
#                 cannot, so this one inverts the comparison: it hashes the handful of literals the
#                 LOCAL BOX can derive and reports which hashed rows they matched. A denied row this
#                 box cannot supply plaintext for is NOT an arm here -- the Go guard still catches it
#                 at test time, and the local never-push token file is how an operator closes it for
#                 the pre-post gate. Every run prints hashes=N matched=M so the gap is a number.
#
# The two are COMPLEMENTARY and neither certifies the other.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NAMING CONVENTION -- USE A CLASS NAME WITH PROVENANCE, NEVER AN INSTANCE
#
# The fleet's own discussion of this class is the fastest way the class GROWS: arguing about the
# IPv4 arm put seven new matchable strings on the shared surface in forty minutes, and every one is
# indistinguishable to every arm from the thing being guarded. When a post, a commit message, a
# board row or a census report must refer to one of these, it names the CLASS AND ITS PROVENANCE:
#
#     the «ipv4» in <lane>'s <item> line          the «unc» in <file>:<line>
#     the «profile-path» in <lane>'s <item>       the «account» in <file>:<line>
#     the «version-quad» in <lane>'s <item>       the «host» in <lane>'s <item>
#
# The class alone is not enough -- a reader cannot tell a known negative from a leak from a bare
# «ipv4». The provenance is what makes the sentence decidable without the value.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MASKING -- THE REPORT AND THE REFUSAL ARE MASKED IDENTICALLY
#
# The REFUSAL path is the only path that runs when a real identifier is actually present, so it is
# the path that must not print one. It does not get its own renderer: refusal and report are the
# same lines from the same function. Every hit prints ARM, PASS, LINE NUMBER, a MASKED rendering and
# a short fingerprint -- and never the matched line and never the matched value.
#
#   «ipv4»            N.x.x.x                first octet only
#   everything else   <*REDACTED-<len>*>     COORD's rule: length only, no fragment
#   fingerprint       fp=<8 hex>             FNV-1a of the lower-cased value, so two different hits
#                                            stay distinguishable while neither is readable
#
# --unmask is for a LOCAL CONSOLE ONLY and is OFF by default. It adds the matched VALUE in the clear
# and the matched LINE rendered through COORD's line rule -- longest literal first, so a contained
# literal is never masked ahead of the literal that contains it (masking a 7-character account
# before the 13-character machine name that contains it renders the machine as
# `<*REDACTED-7*>-...`, which discloses exactly the infrastructure detail the order forbids), then
# the profile-root, home-prefix and share-prefix shape masks, then truncation at 160 characters. NO
# POST TOOL EVER PASSES IT, and nothing --unmask prints may be pasted into a post.
#

# MODES
#   entry <file>              whole-entry census. Refuses on ANY hit. STRICT.
#   converted <file>...       STRICT census over a tracked CONVERTED GO TEST SOURCE, in which the
#                             arms the definition marks [CONVERTED-CONTEXT] -- the LITERAL-shaped
#                             ones -- are REPORTED with their counts and cannot refuse, while every
#                             other arm refuses exactly as in entry. REFUSES TO RUN (rc 2) on a path
#                             that is not one. See CONVERTED SOURCES below.
#   subject <string>          the same census over one string (a commit subject). STRICT.
#   tree <file> <baseline>    DELTA census over a tree-wide surface: hits in <file> at the worktree
#                             (or at HEAD if it is not on disk) MINUS hits in `git show
#                             <baseline>:<file>`. Refuses ONLY on hits this post ADDS. Prints the
#                             pre-existing count per arm loudly -- a pre-existing hit is not this
#                             post's to fix and not this post's to be blocked by, but it is never
#                             silent.
#   selftest                  the triad: PLANTS that must refuse, KNOWN NEGATIVES that must pass,
#                             and the DECLARED SET. Plants live only in the test's temp files and
#                             are never echoed; the output names arms and PASS/FAIL only.
#
# RULE 4 IS ADJACENCY, NEVER A WINDOW. A version word is allowed to excuse a quad only from the
# quad's OWN whitespace-delimited word or from the word immediately before or immediately after it.
# The first draft read a 56/32-character window and C2's A/B showed what that costs: a routable-
# shaped quad ALONE was refused, and the same quad with any version word loose in the window read
# CLEAN. A window is a laundering surface -- it lets a sentence exonerate an address that has nothing
# to do with it, and a lane that wanted to spell one only had to mention a version nearby.
#
# RUN-TIME TOKEN ARMS ARE BOUNDED BY THE DENIED SET. A derived token is a GUESS about what this box
# is called; on a container it is an ordinary English word. C2 measured 4348 pre-existing hits from
# RUNTIME_ACCOUNT and RUNTIME_OWNERNAME on its own box from exactly that. A derivation is now used
# only if it is 5+ characters, is not a stop-listed generic account name, AND is in the denied set --
# its hash a row in coord-identifier-hashes.txt, or its literal a line in the local never-push token
# file. The denied set is the authority on which names are forbidden; a derivation that is not in it
# is a name this fleet never denied. An arm that fails those bars prints
# `<ARM>: token not in the denied set, arm inert` and does not fire -- reported, never silent.
#
# STRICT vs DELTA. In STRICT mode the IPv4 arm runs with NO context exclusion at all: a lane must
# not be able to spell an identifier by making the sentence around it sound like documentation, and
# the cost of the strict reading falls on the writer, as one rewrite of their own post. The version,
# branch, assembly and documentation-constant context rules apply ONLY in tree mode, where their job
# is to CLASSIFY the pre-existing hits of a long shared surface -- an unclassified total is a number,
# never a finding. So does rule 6, the POSITION-MAP FUNCTION-LITERAL rule (2026-09-28): a quad that is
# exactly the closure-counter suffix of one funcLits entry, inside the FOURTH argument of a
# GoPositionMap record, is excluded and counted as `position-map-funclit`. It reads the record around
# the quad, so it is a context rule, and STRICT refuses it for the reason it refuses the others -- a
# lane can write its sentence as a record. The reasoning is on the rule, in scanIpv4.
# THE ONE EXCLUSION STRICT MODE TAKES is the release_literal ADMIT SET (rule 5): it
# is read on the QUAD'S OWN CHARACTERS and on nothing around it, so unlike a context rule it cannot
# be arranged by the sentence a lane writes -- which is exactly why a context rule is refused here
# and a shape admit is not. What it costs is stated on that arm's own line in the definition.
# Every other arm is identical in both modes.
#
# `entry`/`subject` ask "does what I am about to write carry one?". `tree` asks "does what I am
# about to write ADD one to a surface that already holds some?". Two questions; a clean reading from
# one does not certify the other.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONVERTED SOURCES -- WHY THE LITERAL ARMS COME OFF, AND ONLY THERE (2026-09-22)
#
# A converted Go test source carries GO'S OWN TEST DATA, converted verbatim. STRICT's whole rationale
# is that "the cost of the strict reading falls on the writer, as one rewrite of their own post" --
# and that is FALSE of a file the lane did not author, exactly as it was false of the evidence record
# that moved the documentation-constant admit into strict. MEASURED on two lanes' H10 re-bank shards
# on the day this mode was added: 13 refusals on one and 25 on the other, over staged `*_test.cs`
# under src/core, and every value was found verbatim in the same package's own `*_test.go` under the
# pinned GOROOT -- a dnsName «ipv4» in a certificate test, policy-test names, a base64 position map
# whose characters satisfy the quad arm, a loopback-name-and-port literal satisfying host_ctx. The lanes ran repoguard
# by hand and explained the count in prose on every shard. The tool says it instead.
#
# WHAT MOVES: only the arms the DEFINITION marks [CONVERTED-CONTEXT]. Nothing is listed in this
# script -- an arm is declared once, in the patterns file, with every other property of it. A run
# whose downgrade set reads EMPTY is an instrument failure (rc 2), not a run that happens to equal
# entry.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT MOVE: profile_root, home_unix, the unc_ arms and the run-time token arms refuse in
# converted mode exactly as in entry. A REAL identifier reaching a converted file is not Go's data --
# it is an absolute source path baked into an emission, or an account name in a captured line -- and
# that is precisely the class the repository's own guard keeps its denied-token pass running for over
# the very fixtures whose STRUCTURAL pass it skips (fleetIsUpstreamFixture). A unc_ hit here is
# therefore either the JSON/C#/Go escape the unc_escape admit already recognises IN BOTH MODES, or it
# refuses and the lane reads it against the guard. STATED RESIDUAL: an escaped literal whose host
# token is not that recognised escape shape still refuses in this mode.
#
# THE GATE OF RECORD for the TRACKED TREE is repoguard's TestNoFleetIdentifiersInTrackedFiles, which
# already admits this class by file. This mode is the PRE-POST reading of the same file, and it is
# STRICTER than that guard by construction: the guard skips the whole structural pass for a
# `*_test.cs`; this keeps every structural arm but the marked ones. `entry` remains the gate for
# messages, docs and scripts, and a file that is not a converted source is refused INTO it.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  clean
#   1  refused -- one or more hits (for `tree`, one or more ADDED hits)
#   2  misuse, or the instrument could not measure. A gate that cannot measure does not pass.
#   3  self-test failed
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THREE PASSES (R's shape, kept)
#   PASS 1  every arm, per line. Token candidates are tokenised as the Go guard tokenises them.
#   PASS 2  every arm, over each ADJACENT LINE PAIR joined with the whitespace at the break removed
#           (trailing on the left, indentation on the right). A line-anchored census cannot see a
#           token WRAPPED ACROSS A LINE BREAK, and joining on a bare newline alone still misses the
#           two commonest real shapes -- an indented continuation and a trailing space at the break.
#           Reported only when the match SPANS the join, so PASS 2 never re-reports PASS 1.
#   PASS 3  the run-time token arms ONLY, as a bare substring over an ALPHANUMERICS-ONLY reduction
#           of the line and of the joined pair. This catches a token broken by separators INSIDE a
#           component, which run-and-component tokenising cannot see. It is sound for pure
#           alphanumeric tokens and would over-fire wildly on the path arms, so it is scoped to the
#           token arms and to tokens of 4+ characters, and it skips what PASS 1 or 2 already found.
#
# INSTRUMENT FAILURE IS A REFUSAL, NEVER A CLEAN READ. R's tool gets this from `grep rc > 1`; there
# is no grep in this pipeline, so the same property is carried by four checks: the patterns file must
# be readable and yield 1+ arms; the input must be readable; awk must exit 0; and the arm count awk
# reports must equal the arm count this script counts independently from the same file. Any of them
# failing exits 2. A guard that cannot read its input PASSES it -- that is how a placeholder arm once
# failed open -- so none of these is allowed to be silent.
#
# No `set -o pipefail` and no `| grep -q` anywhere: awk writes its report, its keys and its status to
# FILES and this script reads them with redirects, so there is no pipeline whose exit code could be
# read from the wrong end. Every count is tested on its RAW value.

# section of coord-identifier-hashes.txt, generated from the Go guard's fleetPublicHandles.
#
# A candidate that is not an ADMIT row is DROPPED, silently and by construction -- it is not that the
# admit is inert, it is that the word was never ruled a handle. The count is reported either way, so
# `admits=N matched=0` on a box that cannot derive them reads as "the arms refuse exactly as they did
# before", which is the safe direction and is a number rather than an inference.
#
# The candidates, and there are only three shapes because a wider guess is a wider admit:
#   the local part of `git config --get user.email`               -- the published address form
#   every alphabetic piece of `git config --get user.name`, joined -- the organisation-handle shape
#   the first letter of the FIRST piece + the LAST piece           -- the work-mail handle shape

        # crypto/internal/cryptotest's package_info.cs read four ipv4 hits in BOTH modes, all four of
        # them depth-four suffixes; corpus-wide, six records carry such suffixes (two production

        # ⚠ WHY NOT IN STRICT, and it is rule 5's own test applied rather than a preference. This rule
        # reads the LINE AROUND the quad -- the record's prefix, which argument it sits in, and the
        # characters either side of it -- and a lane can arrange every one of those by writing its
        # sentence AS A RECORD. That is a CONTEXT rule, exactly as rules 1, 2 and 4 are, and STRICT
        # refuses context rules by design. The authorship argument is real -- nobody writes these by
        # hand, and a rewritten suffix corrupts the frame names the runtime derives from it -- but this
        # file's answer to "the lane did not author these bytes" is a MODE whose door is a property of
        # the INPUT'S PATH (`converted`), never a context rule inside `entry`: package_test_info.cs and
        # package_info_internal_test.cs are through that door already, where the quad arm is reported

        # re-attribute anything the others were measured on.

# ---- the run-time token arms ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tokenised exactly as the Go guard tokenises: maximal [a-z0-9._-] runs, plus each dot/hyphen/
# underscore component. That is what makes a machine name and the account name inside it both match,
# and what makes a path ENDING in the token fire -- the shape a both-sides separator rule misses.
#
# ⚠ THE PUBLIC-HANDLE ADMIT (ruled 2026-09-22) is consulted HERE and in scanTokensReduced, and ONLY
# for the arms the DEFINITION marks [PUBLIC-HANDLE-ADMIT]. It reads the ENCLOSING WORD in the
# original text -- never the token, never the line -- and it is an EXACT hash of a whole word, so
# containment can never admit anything.
#
# WHY IT MUST READ THE ORIGINAL TEXT rather than the surface the arm fired on: the hits this ruling
# is about are pass-3 hits, and the reduced surface has NO word boundaries left by construction, so
# "the enclosing word" does not exist there. Going back to the text is what makes the decision a
# word decision in both passes.
#
# EVERY occurrence must be inside an admitted word, and at least one must exist. Both halves are
# load-bearing and both are controlled: a line carrying the handle AND the bare account name still
# refuses (some occurrence is not admitted), and a token that exists only across a fused line break
# -- inside no single word -- finds zero enclosing words and refuses, which is the safe direction.
#
# PERCENT-ESCAPES ARE SEPARATORS for the word split. The five README URLs this ruling was measured
# on spell the handle after `%20`, an encoded SPACE, so without this the enclosing word would be the
# two hex digits glued to the handle and the admit would miss the only surface it was ruled for.
# COST, stated: a percent-encoded PATH whose segment is an admitted handle is admitted by this arm.
# The structural profile/home arms are untouched and are the mitigation, exactly as the denied-token
# pass is the mitigation for the unicode-escape admit above.
#
# THE DOTTED MODULE-PATH SPELLING (COORD ruling 2026-10-03). A Go module path under an admitted
# handle reaches C# and NuGet with its slashes turned into DOTS: the namespace `go.github.com.<handle>`,
# the ID `nugetgo.github.com.<handle>.<module>`, the project file `github.com.<handle>.<module>.csproj`.
# The dot is a WORD character for the split above, so the enclosing word is the whole dotted path and
# never equals the handle. dottedHandleOK admits exactly that shape and nothing wider: the word is cut on
# dots, an admitted handle must be a WHOLE segment directly after a `github` `com` segment pair, and every
# segment that contains the denied literal must be such a segment. A different host, a segment that only
# CONTAINS the handle, or the bare literal in another segment of the same word still refuses.

# STRICTER than the gate on exactly the files batches re-emit; the mirror is what closes that.

# ⚠ MIRROR, NEVER WIDEN. All four tests are carried even though converted mode's own door admits
# only two of them (an .auto or .test name never reaches here): a copy reduced to "the cases that can

# idc_is_embed_payload PATH -- fleetEmbedPayloads, MIRRORED (COORD, H10 close, 2026-09-23). The Go
# gate admits a //go:embed PAYLOAD the way it admits testdata: Go 1.24's
# internal/trace/traceviewer/static/trace_viewer_full.html carries a JavaScript regex whose escaped
# character class reads as a UNC host, and a payload is the one way Go's own bytes reach the corpus
# outside a testdata directory. The Go side is src/go2cs/internal/repoguard/fleetIdentifierCensus_test.go
# (fleetEmbedPayloads); every change here moves with it.
#
# THE SAME DERIVATION, NOT A PATH LIST: the file is a payload when a project file in one of its own
# ancestor directories, at or below src/core/, carries the item the converter mints for it --
#     <EmbeddedResource Include="<path relative to that csproj, XML-escaped>" LogicalName="go.embed/..." />
# -- which is exactly an Include that resolves INSIDE the csproj's directory. A testdata path is not
# counted here (the fixture predicate above already admits it), as the Go derivation does not count it.
#
# TRACKED, where that can be asked: inside a git work tree, the project file AND the payload must both
# be tracked, as the Go gate reads only tracked files. Outside one (the self-test's temp tree) there is
# no index to ask and the files on disk are read.
#
# STRICTER THAN THE GO SIDE, stated and allowed (mirror, never widen): a path carrying `.` or `..`
# segments is never a payload here, and an Include must equal the path byte for byte after unescaping
# where Go compares it after path.Clean.
