# Known issues

This page lists specific bugs, each with a workaround. For the limits that come with running Go on .NET, and
the rough spots real code hits today, see [Limitations](Limitations.md).

## Ubuntu's packaged .NET 10 can end a converted program early

On Ubuntu's own build of .NET 10 (the `dotnet` installed with `apt`, runtime identifier `ubuntu.*-x64`), a
converted program that raises and recovers Go panics inside a hot loop can stop in one of two ways under the
default tiered compilation:
- a fatal `Internal CLR error. (0x80131506)`;
- more often, a SILENT exit with code 0 and truncated output.

The fault needs the JIT's on-stack replacement. Microsoft's build of the same .NET version does not show it, and
neither does Windows. No converted Go program has reproduced it so far, only a synthetic reproduction.

**To avoid it**, run on Microsoft's .NET build, or turn off quick JIT for loops in the converted executable's
project file, which removes on-stack replacement:

```xml
<TieredCompilationQuickJitForLoops>false</TieredCompilationQuickJitForLoops>
```

Converted executable projects carry this line, commented out. It costs about 90 ms (16%) more startup time,
and steady-state loop speed stays within measurement noise. It becomes the default if a converted Go program
ever reproduces the fault.
