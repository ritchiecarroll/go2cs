// The runtime package's PROCESS-CONTROL surface, reimplemented on managed primitives.
//
// Everything here is a public runtime API whose Go body drives machinery that does not exist
// under the CLR — stopTheWorld/startTheWorld, gcStart and the mark/sweep engine, mcall(gosched_m),
// and the g/m/p stack walk. Converted faithfully they compile, then die on the first getg() or
// mcall() assembly stub: sync's TestPool died in debug.SetGCPercent, TestOnceXGC in runtime.GC →
// gcStart → acquirem → getg, TestParallelReaders in GOMAXPROCS → stopTheWorldGC → semacquire →
// getg, and runtime.Gosched → mcall took the whole test host down mid-run.
//
// The fork this takes is the one sync's Mutex/notifyList established (docs/Baseline-vs-
// FullConversion.md, "Hand-owning a package to make it OPERATIONAL"): where a Go mechanism has no
// managed counterpart but its PUBLIC CONTRACT does, reimplement the CONTRACT at the API boundary
// and never emulate the mechanism. The alternative — synthesizing a fake g/m so the converted
// scheduler can walk it — buys nothing: the code underneath would still need a real run queue, a
// real heap, and real stacks. Everything below these entry points stays auto-converted and simply
// becomes unreachable.
//
// The converter drops the auto forms of exactly these declarations (manualConversionFuncs
// ["runtime"] in go2cs/manualTypeOperations.go), leaving a placeholder comment at each site.
//
// Honest divergences, stated once:
//   - GOMAXPROCS is a real GET/SET of a remembered value but does NOT cap parallelism: a goroutine
//     is a managed thread and the CLR schedules it. The universal test idiom
//     `defer runtime.GOMAXPROCS(runtime.GOMAXPROCS(n))` is exactly right; a program that measures
//     actual parallelism against it is capability-divergent.
//   - Stack() walks the MANAGED stack and renders it in GO'S SHAPE (`<pkg>.<Func>()` + a
//     tab-indented `<file>:<line>`), because a traceback is observable output that Go programs and
//     Go's own tests grep by package-qualified function name. Frames that already unwound are
//     recovered for the case that matters: while a panic is in flight, golib's snapshot of the
//     panic's origin is appended below the live frames — where Go's traceback also shows them,
//     since a deferred call runs on top of gopanic. Frames that are not converted Go code (golib,
//     the BCL, the test host) keep their .NET names rather than being given invented Go ones, and
//     Go's `+0x<offset>` PC deltas are omitted.
//   - Stack(all=true) enumerates EVERY live goroutine — golib's registry, in goid order, as Go
//     dumps them — with a truthful header per goroutine: the id the registry minted, and the wait
//     reason the park accounting recorded (Go's own waitReasonStrings; see golib's WaitReason).
//     The CALLING goroutine's block carries real frames; every other goroutine's carries ONE line
//     saying its stack is unavailable, because the CLR has no supported cross-thread stack walk and
//     inventing frames for an unwalked stack is the one thing a traceback must not do. Capturing a
//     goroutine's own stack AT PARK TIME is Stage B of docs/phase4/DESIGN-cooperative-scheduler.md,
//     held behind the synthetic-PC registry that would symbolize it. Two further honest limits:
//     `running` covers Go's _Grunnable as well as _Grunning (no P, no run queue, nothing to ask),
//     and Go's ` (scan)` / `, N minutes` / `, locked to thread` header decorations are omitted
//     rather than invented.
//   - ReadMemStats fills the fields the CLR genuinely measures and leaves the allocator-internal
//     ones (Mallocs/Frees/HeapObjects/BySize) zero rather than inventing numbers. The per-GC pause
//     history, LastGC, PauseTotalNs and NumGC come from golib's GcPauseRecorder (one gen2 recorder,
//     one ring, one snapshot shared with runtime/debug.readGCStats); HeapReleased is
//     max(0, committedHighWater - currentCommitted). Both are docs/phase4/DESIGN-readmemstats-
//     surface.md, ratified 2026-08-21 — read the recorder's own header for the mechanism, the
//     measured boundaries and the GO2CS_GC_PAUSE_HISTORY=0 escape hatch. Two MemStats invariants
//     stated here rather than repaired, because repairing either would mean inventing or clamping a
//     measured number (§4.4): `Sys == StackSys + MSpanSys + ... + OtherSys` is FALSE (Sys is
//     committed bytes while every breakdown term is an allocator arena the CLR does not partition),
//     and `HeapIdle >= HeapReleased` can be false after a large release (HeapIdle is instantaneous,
//     HeapReleased is a difference against a historical high-water mark). GCCPUFraction stays ZERO
//     for the same rule: the adjacent CLR quantity, PauseTimePercentage, is pause time as a share of
//     wall time since the last GC, where Go's field is GC's share of the program's available CPU
//     since it started — a number in the right range and of the wrong kind.
//   - Goexit is exact for the GOROUTINE case (defers run, recover() sees nil, no other goroutine is
//     affected) and GATED for the main goroutine, whose "main ends but the program keeps running"
//     shape has no managed counterpart yet — docs/phase4/DESIGN-goexit.md option C.
//   - gcount — and therefore NumGoroutine, /sched/goroutines, and the goroutine profile's size and
//     count — reports golib's live goroutine registry. It COUNTS UP EARLY-BY-ONE AND DECAYS LATE.
//     Measured against Go on the same program: with eight goroutines blocked on a channel it reads 8
//     where Go reads 9, and immediately after the WaitGroup releases them it reads 9 where Go reads
//     1. Go's own caveat — "all these variables can be changed concurrently, so the result can be
//     inconsistent" — covers the climb; the DECAY LAG is ours, because a goroutine's registry slot is
//     retired after its body returns rather than at the instant it does. Stated in those terms rather
//     than as "approximate" because the DIRECTION is what matters to consumers: a leak check sampling
//     during teardown reads a stale HIGH count, which reads as a leak rather than as a miscount.
//     Not repaired: no consumer's guard needs prompt decay today (net/http/httputil's leak check
//     passes against these values at its `<= 4` threshold), so a timing fix would be speculative
//     machinery. It is a board item whose trigger is the first flaky leak check, or the first
//     consumer that needs prompt decay.
//   - LockOSThread/UnlockOSThread carry GO'S WHOLE BODY, and the split is worth stating exactly.
//     The BINDING they exist to provide — "this goroutine will not be migrated to another OS
//     thread" — holds BY CONSTRUCTION here, since go2cs runs each goroutine on its own managed
//     thread; that half is a no-op and always was. The ACCOUNTING is NOT: `m.lockedExt`,
//     `m.lockedInt` and the `m.lockedg`/`g.lockedm` back-links are state Go's own suite reads back
//     through `runtime.LockOSCounts`, and until 2026-09-13 these four bodies were empty, so the
//     counters read 0,0 where Go reads 1,0. ⚠ This bullet claimed the WHOLE pair was a no-op by
//     construction, which conflated the two halves and is why the gap survived: the binding was
//     the reason given, and the accounting was never separately checked.
//   - Callers()/callers()/Frames.Next() walk the MANAGED stack projected to GO-LOGICAL frames:
//     only converted Go declarations and function literals count — adapter shells (IGoAdapter) and
//     go2cs-gen forwarders are dispatch plumbing Go has no frame for, and golib/the BCL/the test
//     host are not Go code. RELATIVE depths between two Callers calls on one goroutine therefore
//     match Go's logical model (io's multiReader flatten tests assert exactly this). A host method
//     marked GoStackRoot reports the Go frame it stands in for (the test host's testing.tRunner),
//     and a goroutine's walk ends at runtime.goexit as Go's does; the main goroutine's runtime.main
//     root is not modeled. PC values are opaque
//     process-lifetime tokens, never addresses; Frame.Function is the Go spelling (goFrameName);
//     Frame.File/Line name the GO position the conversion recorded for that frame, and the
//     converted `.cs` position where it recorded none (goFramePosition). FuncForPC
//     and Frame.Func stayed unimplemented/nil while a *Func had no managed referent; that
//     premise EXPIRED when ManagedPointerTokens landed, and FuncForPC/Func.Name are managed
//     below as of 2026-08-29, joined by Func.Entry/Func.FileLine as of 2026-09-02. Frame.Func stayed
//     nil until 2026-09-28 (census A2, D3): Frames.Next now sets it for every Go frame, interned per
//     function, with Frame.startLine beside it (see Frames.Next). getcallersp
//     itself remains an honest stub: a caller's stack pointer has no managed answer, so the
//     chain is severed HERE, at the API boundary that does (the methodName precedent).
//     runtime.Caller stays AUTO-converted and works through the same walk, because the funnel it
//     calls — the lower-case `callers` — is hand-owned here too, so it reads the same positions a
//     traceback does. The POSITION MAP is what supplies them: one `[assembly: GoPositionMap]`
//     record per converted file, emitted into that file, carrying the Go file's identity AND its
//     C#-line → Go-line table together. The pair is INDIVISIBLE by construction (coordinator
//     ruling, 2026-08-21) — a Go file paired with a C# line is a position in NEITHER tree — so a
//     frame either has a record and reports a Go position that exists, or has none and reports the
//     converted `.cs` position, which is what golib, the BCL, the hand-owned test host and every
//     whole-file hand-own do. Nothing composes one half from the other. `log`'s TestAll pins
//     `(63|65)` in log_test.go and now reads them, because the conversion recorded them.
//
// Hand-owned: there is no managed_impl.go, so a -stdlib reconvert never regenerates this file.

    // panicdivide for an integer divide), then the frames the panic was raised in, then the deferring
    // function. The CLR has unwound those frames before the emitted finally runs the deferred call.
    // They survive as the panic's SiteTrace, the raised exception's trace from its throw site to its
    // first catching frame, and this splices them back. Go's lines are go1.24.13's: gopanic calls the
    // deferred func at panic.go:792.

    // otherwise, so a panic re-raised past its first catcher, a recursive activation, or a site golib
    // could not place splices NOTHING: a missing splice is a known divergence, and a wrong one is a
    // silent lie. The owner is the activation AND its thread (SiteOwnerThread): activation numbers are
    // per thread, and range-over-func carries a panic from a coro's thread to the ranging goroutine.
    // Two kinds of site pass:
    //   - one that ends at the DEFERRING FUNCTION (its own catch caught the panic first): the site's
    //     last Go frame is that function, checked again against the next live Go frame by method, and
    //     dropped, since the live walk reports it;
    //   - one that ends at the RUN, in exactly two cases, and the chain then continues with the panic
    //     Beneath, whose gopanic called the deferred call: the zero-argument nil-deferred-func thunk
    //     (no Go frame of its own; its fault frames alone), or the deferred delegate that is itself the
    //     panic's first catcher (SiteIsTheDeferredCall; all its Go frames stay). Every OTHER panic a
    //     deferred call raises is refused: the converter's defer wrappers (`() => c()` for a named func
    //     type, `defer panic(v)`'s thunk, the lambdas for a call whose results are dropped) are
    //     indistinguishable at run time from Go's closures, and Go ELIDES its deferwrap except over the
    //     panic machinery, so any of them would splice a frame Go does not show, or misname one Go does
    //     (COORD's verification of the re-cut, B2 and C3). A stated missing splice until the converter
    //     marks its defer wrappers.
    // Only the fault kinds golib tags where the panic is RAISED are spliced: an explicit panic(v), a nil
    // dereference and an integer divide. Every other runtime error (goPanicIndex, the goPanicSlice family,

    // What this does NOT restore is Go's *Func as a window onto pclntab — there is still no

    // recovered from a function value or a traceback frame: its name (reflect's own abi_test.go
    // names every subtest `t.Run(runtime.FuncForPC(fn.Pointer()).Name(), ...)`, and answering ""
    // there made Go's testing package renumber the subtests #00, #01, ... turning one naming gap
    // into 83 orphaned comparison rows that read as 83 defects), and — since 2026-09-02 — its
    // Entry() and FileLine(pc). Both fell through to the auto-converted funcInfo()/firstmoduledata
    // walk until now, which is a permanent empty stub (symtab.cs's Ꮡfirstmoduledata, assigned
    // exactly once, to a moduledata whose pclntable is always empty) and could never resolve —
    // structurally, not intermittently, which is why TestCaller (runtime_test, symtab_test.go)
