Package reflect implements run-time reflection, allowing a program to manipulate objects with arbitrary types. The typical use is to take a value with static type interface{} and extract its dynamic type information by calling TypeOf, which returns a Type.

A call to ValueOf returns a Value representing the run-time data. Zero takes a Type and returns a Value representing a zero value for that type.

See "The Laws of Reflection" for an introduction to reflection in Go: [https://golang.org/doc/articles/laws\_of\_reflection.html](https://golang.org/doc/articles/laws_of_reflection.html)
