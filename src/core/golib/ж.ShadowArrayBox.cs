/// <summary>
/// A Go <c>*[N]T</c> over a NATIVE block whose element type <typeparamref name="T"/> carries managed
/// references: the elements live in a MANAGED <see cref="array{T}"/> that shadows the block, while the
/// pointer's ADDRESS stays the block's.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// WHY A SHADOW (A16, COORD ruling 2026-09-28). The page allocator's grow installs each L2 chunk block
/// as <c>*(*uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;p.chunks[l1])) = uintptr(sysAlloc(l2Size))</c>, a pointer to
/// <c>[8192]pallocData</c> over native memory. <see cref="NativeArrayBox{T}"/> serves that shape only for
/// an UNMANAGED element: <c>pallocData</c> is a generated struct over golib <see cref="array{T}"/>s, a
/// managed type at two levels, so no element ref can alias native bytes and the native door refuses it
/// by name. Neither a native view (the bytes are not C#'s layout) nor a pinned array (the CLR pins no
/// reference-bearing array) can hold it; a managed store can.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// WHY THE ADDRESS STAYS NATIVE. Go keeps using the block as memory: export_test's
/// <c>FreePageAlloc</c> hands each block to <c>sysFree</c>, and <c>enableChunkHugePages</c> to
/// <c>sysHugePage</c>. A plain managed box answers <c>ж -&gt; uintptr</c> by pinning its array's data,
/// which the CLR refuses for a reference-bearing array ("Object contains references", measured on the
/// windows re-probe) -- and even an order token would hand the kernel an address it never allocated.
/// Answering the block's own address as <see cref="NativeAddress"/> makes every address consumer see
/// exactly what Go's does, and the memory Go allocated and accounts for (sysStat) is released by Go's
/// own call. The block itself is never read or written: it stands unused behind the managed store, as
/// Go's memory does behind the elements.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// WHAT READS WHAT. Element access (<c>chunkOf</c>'s <c>&amp;p.chunks[l1][l2]</c>) goes through
/// <see cref="Value"/>, the managed array, whose element boxes are ordinary managed ones.
/// <see cref="TryGetNativeArrayView(Type)"/> answers null, so the element door never builds a native
/// window over the block. The address (<see cref="NativeAddress"/>, <see cref="PointerOrderToken"/>)
/// is the block's. <c>NativeAddress</c>-gated byte arithmetic (<c>unsafe.Add</c>'s byte stepping,
/// <c>ReadPointerWord</c>) would therefore address the UNUSED block; no corpus site does arithmetic on
/// this pointer (Go indexes it), and a new one would read zeros rather than the store -- stated here so
/// it is found, not assumed away.
